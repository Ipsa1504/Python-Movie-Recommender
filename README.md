# Python-Movie-Recommender

Overview

This project provides a step-by-step tutorial on building a practical Recommendation System using Python and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS). The system demonstrates both retrieval-based and ranking-based recommendation techniques using the popular MovieLens dataset.

This tutorial is designed for students, aspiring data scientists, and professionals to learn how to implement an end-to-end recommender system pipeline from scratch.

Features

End-to-end recommendation pipeline:

Data preprocessing & exploration

Model training and evaluation

Making personalized movie recommendations

Implements Collaborative Filtering using TensorFlow Recommenders

Covers both retrieval (finding candidate items) and ranking (scoring & ordering items) approaches

Simple, modular, and easy-to-understand code

Includes metrics like Recall@K for evaluating recommendations

Ready-to-run Jupyter Notebook with minimal setup

Technologies & Libraries

Language: Python 3.x

ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS)

Data Handling: Pandas, Numpy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset

Dataset used: MovieLens 100k

Contains user ratings for movies with attributes such as:

User ID

Movie ID

Rating

Timestamp

Used for training, validation, and testing the recommender models

jupyter notebook


Open notebooks/movie_recommender.ipynb to start.

How to Use

Load the MovieLens dataset.

Preprocess the data to create user-item interactions.

Train a retrieval model to generate candidate items.

Train a ranking model to score and rank recommendations.

Evaluate model performance using Recall@K and other metrics.

Generate personalized movie recommendations for a user.

Sample Output

Top-5 movie recommendations for User ID 123:

1. The Shawshank Redemption
2. Forrest Gump
3. The Godfather
4. Fight Club
5. The Dark Knight

Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience building collaborative filtering recommendation systems.

Understanding the difference between retrieval and ranking models.

Working with TensorFlow Recommenders for real-world data.

Learning to evaluate models using metrics like Recall@K.
