## Overview

This project is a **step-by-step tutorial** on building a practical **Recommendation System** using Python and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS).  
The system demonstrates both **retrieval-based** and **ranking-based** recommendation techniques using the popular **MovieLens dataset**.

This tutorial is designed for students, aspiring data scientists, and professionals to learn how to implement an **end-to-end recommender system pipeline** from scratch.
